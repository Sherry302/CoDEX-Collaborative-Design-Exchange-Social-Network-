# CoDEX-Collaborative-Design-Exchange-Social-Network
The idea of the website is to build a platform where people on the same campus can meet and collaborate with others who have certain skill sets, share certain interests, but hard to reach in routine daily life. The website has several channels like design, music, workout and hacking, where users can post threads with short text, images and certain rewards to call for help or find buddy. 

CoDEX is developed with Django. Database is MySQL. CoDEX was deployed in AWS before, and worked very well. To test locally, you need to do the following configuration: 
1. In your "/etc/hosts" file, map "127.0.0.1" to "http://test1.com:8000"

Packages needed to install:
1. pip install django-social-auth 
2. pip install Pillow
